I was playing basketball in high school, and those were the times when everybody started to be crazy about Kobe here. So I did feel that an era has ended on 13 April. Celebrating his career, Kaggle started a competition where you have to predict missing shot info in his stats.
As a small contribution, I was curious what was his shot probability depending on the location on the court. So I wrote a quick notebook and uploaded it to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/agostontorok/kobe-bryant-shot-selection/kobe-shot-probability-plot). It looks that he did not choose position because of higher probability, he was almost equally good everywhere :) Mr. Bryant, my appreciation.
